Summary: Run the solution of the free vibration problem for multimaterial domains created in Comsol.

## Set up the simulation

### Create the mesh

Use Comsol to create a mesh. Make sure to create materials for each material domain and  assign the material to the domain. The material parameters don't matter: the materials are not exported themselves. Just the mesh. Remember the numbers of the materials (1, 2, ...): the parameter file  will need to refer to these numbers.

### Export  the mesh

Export the mesh as a NASTRAN file. Use the settings shown in this image:
![Mesh export settings](mesh_export_settings.png)

### Create a parameter file

Create the parameter file for the simulation. Call this file whatever you wish, for definiteness we will assume `"twoblocks.json"`, but it is arbitrary. It does needs to be reflected in the executable file below. The parameter file is a JSON file with this structure:
```
{
    "meshfile": "twoblocks.nas",
    "neigvs": 20,
    "frequencyshift": 10.0,
    "materials": {
        "2": {
            "name": "aluminum",
            "E": 7.0e10,
            "nu": 0.34,
            "rho": 2700.0
        },
        "1": {
            "name": "steel",
            "E": 2.05e11,
            "nu": 0.3,
            "rho": 7850.0
        }
    }
}
```
Change the parameters appropriately. Materials can be added. Note that the numbers of the materials in the Comsol model are recorded here as strings. 

## Run the simulation

Create the file `run.jl` with the following contents:
```
pkg"add https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/Comsol2FinEtoolsModel.jl.git")
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("Comsol2FinEtoolsModel"); Pkg.instantiate()
using Comsol2FinEtoolsModel: solve_ep

# The name of the parameter file is up to you
parameterfile = "twoblocks.json"
solve_ep(parameterfile)

exit()
```
Note that the name of the parameter JSON file is the one created in the previous section.
